At Cookie Browser (the "App"), your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your data when you use the App.

### 1. Information Collection
- No Personal Data Collection: The App does not collect, store, or share any personal information from users. You are not required to sign up or create an account to use the App.
- Third-Party Websites: As an internet browser, the App enable you to access third-party websites. These websites may collect your personal information, track you using cookies, or implement other methods of data collection. The App is not responsible for how these third-party websites handle your data. Please review the privacy policies of any third-party sites you visit for details on their data collection practices.

### 2. Analytics and Crash Reporting
- The App uses Google Firebase for analytics and crash reporting. While Firebase collects general app usage data (e.g., device type, operating system, and app performance), it does not collect personally identifiable information.
- This data helps us improve the App's performance, user experience, and identify any technical issues. However, this data is not linked to any individual user.

### 3. App Permissions
The App may request the following permissions to enhance user experience:

#### 1. Check Network Connection State
- Purpose: To detect whether the user's network is available and whether it is Wi-Fi or mobile data. This allows the App to give users alerts when downloading files to help manage data usage.
#### 2. Read and Write to Phone's External Storage
- Purpose: This permission is required for user-initiated downloads. The App needs access to read and write files, but this is limited to the App's private directory and public download directories. The App does not access any other storage areas.
#### 3. Get Phone Location Information
- Purpose: Some websites may request your location information (e.g., for maps, weather forecasts). The App itself does not obtain, store, or process this information, but allows websites to request it if needed.
#### 4. Video and Audio Recording
- Purpose: Certain websites may request access to video and audio recording (e.g., for live chat or voice/video services). The App does not collect or store any recordings; it only grants websites the necessary permissions to function.

### 4. Data Usage
- Performance Monitoring: The analytics data collected by Firebase is used exclusively to monitor the App’s performance and diagnose technical issues such as crashes.
- Improvement of Services: We may use aggregate data to enhance and improve the App’s functionality and user experience.

### 5. Third-Party Data Handling
The App itself does not share, sell, or disclose any user data to third parties. However, the websites that you visit through the App may have their own data collection policies. The App does not control or monitor third-party websites and is not responsible for their practices.

### 6. User Responsibility
By using the App, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy. You acknowledge that the websites you visit may collect personal data and agree to review and accept their privacy policies. The App cannot provide any guarantees regarding the privacy practices of third-party websites.

### 7. Security
While the App does not collect or store personal data, we still prioritize security in our operations. We use industry-standard practices to protect the App from unauthorized access, data breaches, and other vulnerabilities.

### 8. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in the App’s functionality or legal requirements. You will be notified of significant changes, and continued use of the App following such changes will signify your acceptance of the updated policy.
