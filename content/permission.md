At Cookie Browser, we value your privacy and security. To enhance your browsing experience, we request certain permissions. Below is a summary of each permission and its purpose.

## Requested Permissions

### Check Network Connection State
Purpose: To detect whether your network is available (Wi-Fi or mobile data). This allows the app to alert you when downloading files, ensuring a smooth experience.

### Read and Write to External Storage
Purpose: This permission is necessary for user-initiated downloads. It allows the app to read and write files to its private directory and public download directories on your device.

### Phone Location Information
Purpose: Some websites you visit may request location information (e.g., maps, weather). The app will display always a message asking for permission each time a site asks to access GPS information. The app itself does not collect or store your location data; it only facilitates the use of such features on websites.

### Video and Audio Recording
Purpose: Certain websites may require access to your device’s camera and microphone (e.g., for video chats). The app does not obtain or store any recordings; it only enables these features when you interact with compatible websites. The app will display always a message asking for permission each time a site asks to add photo or record audio. It never records audio, take pictures or records video unless you opt in each time it asks.

## Your Privacy Matters
We do not track or collect personal information. The requested permissions are solely to improve your app experience.
You can review and manage these permissions in your device’s settings at any time.
For any questions or concerns regarding these permissions, please contact our support team at kijangchat@gmail.com.
